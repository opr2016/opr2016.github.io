      <p>There are a lot of unflavored natural and/or organic protein powders out there. In this blog post, we compare five of the top protein powders; we’ll look at the economics (cost per gram of protein) as well as the sourcing and processing information. It’s surprising how much both cost, source, and processing vary!</p>

<p>Here’s a table summarizing the data. Prices come from Amazon as of 3 April 2016.</p>

<p>In putting together this grid, one thing that really surprised me was how much variability there is in cost. I mean, $12.50 versus $4.21?! That’s huge. The cost difference seems to mostly be explained by package size; five pound bulk containers are much cheaper than one pound or less containers. Hopefully Source, Raw, and Now will release bulk cannisters of their proteins in the future!</p>

<p>As readers of this blog will know, one of my favorite protein powders is Naked Whey, which I think is a insanely high-quality protein source. Based on the chart above, I may start trying Promix as well. Of course, the sourcing and proceessing of each protein source also matters. Here’s what each company has to say about its protein:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Naked Whey</em>: Only One Ingredient: 100% Grass Fed Pure Whey Protein with zero additives. Naked Whey no artificial sweeteners, flavors, or colors and is GMO-Free, Growth Hormone Free, Soy Free and Gluten-Free. All Natural Whey: Our Grass Fed Whey is sourced from small dairy farms in California to bring you a non-denatured whey packed full of essential amino acids, clean protein and glutathione. Cold Processed: Unlike most whey protein powders, Naked Whey is cold processed to ensure zero contamination from chemical detergents (no acid or bleach), synthetic additives, or heavy metals, and this maintains important naturally occurring growth factors.</li>
  <li><em>Promix</em>: ProMix works directly with farms to always give you the best quality and price. 3rd Party Lab Tested for Heavy Metals. Soy-free, Gluten-Free, Nut-free, Acid and Bleach-free, Cold-processed Microfiltration. ProMix Whey comes from the milk of grass-fed cows.</li>
  <li><em>Source</em>: Non-GMO Project Verified, American Humane Association Certified, USDA Organic, Kosher Organic Whey Protein. Pure organic whey from the milk of grass-fed cows from family farms in Northern California Soy-free, Gluten-free, processed without acid or bleach, rBGH/rBST hormone free, non-denatured, cold-processed.</li>
  <li><em>Raw</em>: Only 1 Ingredient: 100% Pure organic whey protein from the milk of grass-fed jersey cows that graze on open pastures over 300 days a year. GMO Free, Soy Free, rBGH/rBST hormone free, Gluten Free, Corn Free, Grass-Fed.</li>
  <li><em>Now Foods</em>: Free of rbgh and antibiotics. All natural - no aspartame, no sucralose, no acesulfame-k.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, the most important things to look at when choosing a whey protein powder are:
1. What are the ingredients other than whey?
2. Am I getting whey protein concenrate or whey protein isolate? (See this post on <a href="http://www.builtlean.com/2013/05/14/whey-concentrate-vs-isolate-whats-the-difference/">BuiltLean</a> for an explanation of the difference.)
3. What is the quality of the milk source and how is it processed?</p>

<p>All of the above products are whey protein concentrate, and all of them have at most one other ingredient. (Promix, Source, and Now include sunflower lecithin (a natural emulsifier that keeps protein shakes from ‘clumping’); Naked and Raw have no ingredients other than whey.) So, for me, the only remaining factor to consider is the quality of the milk used to make the whey, and the way in which the product is processed. Luckily, most of the protein products above are stellar in this
regard! Here’s my summary. A question mark means “unknown”.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Grass-Fed Cows?</th>
      <th>Growth Hormone Free?</th>
      <th>Cold-Processed?</th>
      <th>USDA Organic?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Naked</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Promix</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Source</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Now Foods</td>
      <td>?</td>
      <td>Yes!</td>
      <td>?</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If I had to declare a winner, I’d say that Source ekes out a win over the others – but really, all of the products above seem great to me, and much better than the protein powders I was using just a couple years ago.</p>

<p>As a final thought, one thing I really like about Promix and Source is that their products are independently tested for heavy metal content. Heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, are present in many of our foods, but are unhealthy in any quantity; Promix and Source have third-party labs test their products. (<a href="http://source-organic.com/pages/third-party-verified">Source’s page</a>, and <a href="http://promixnutrition.com/pages/independent-lab-test-results">Promix’s</a>.) Both of their
products are well under the USP Standard limits, which is great! This makes me feel even better about their protein powders, and I’d love to see similar reports from the other companies above.</p>
