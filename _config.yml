# Welcome to Jekyll!


# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

  text: "Hi! I'm Slater, and OrganicProteinReviews is my site for finding, comparing, and reviewing orgainc protein supplements. Back in 2014, I started paying attention to the ingredients in my protein powders, and I didn't like what I saw: Artificial sweeteners, cellulose gums, alkalai-processed cocoa, and a ton of chemicals I didn't understand. I decided I needed to change my nutrition to *natural*, *organic*, *minimally processed* protein sources, and began researching all the organic protein supplements I coul find.  This site is my way of saving and sharing that information! I hope it's helpful to you, and that you can use this site to find a healthy, natural protein source that fits your health and fitness goals!"
