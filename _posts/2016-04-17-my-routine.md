There are a variety of nutrition programs out there, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. Here's what I do, and what I've found over time to work well for me.

# Morning

In the morning, as soon as I wake up, I'll make a half-shake of organic whey. That's one scoop of whey protein powder with about 8 ounces of milk and a little raw cacao. Altogether, that's about 20 grams of protein.

I'll then have a regular breakfast (either greek yoghurt with honey, or three eggs with toast).

# Pre-Workout

Right before my workout, I'll have another half-shake of organic whey, this time with 5 grams of creatine (I use Naked's creatine powder) included. So another 20 grams.

# Post-Workout

Right after my workout, I'll have a full organic protein shake (again, whey). This gives me another 33 grams of protain. Again, I'll add 5 grams of creatine.

# Before Bed

Right before bed, I'll have an organic casein shake, which is about another 33 grams of slow-absorbtion protein. This in theory keeps your body out of a catabolic state overnight.

# In all

All in all, I get about 106 (call it 100) grams of protein through organic protein shakes during the day. I also try to consume additional protein through "normal" meals, and would estimate that I get another 50 or so grams this way. This a pretty simple protein nutrition plan, which is part of the reason I think it works well for me -- it's easy to execute on all stages because they're tied to other events (waking up, working out, etc.) that I have planned in my schedule.
