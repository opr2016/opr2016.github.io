Naked Whey is one of my favorite protein powders, but one concern I had about it -- and other single-ingredient natural protein powders -- is how well it blends. Naked doesn't include any emulsifiers, it's pure whey protein concentrate. Emulsifiers are substances that aid dispersion: They help protein powders mix into milk/water, and then help the powder stay mixed (instead of separating). Emulsifiers aren't necessarily bad: Lots of organic protein powders include organic sunflower lecithin, which is regarded as a natural and safe ingredient. However, I respect Naked for staying true to its principles of having absolutely nothing besides whey in it's powder.

Given that Naked Whey doesn't have any emulsifiers, the question is: Will it blend? Here's my experience.

In the mornings, I like to make a half-size protein shake to keep my body in an anabolic state. I use:

* One scoop of Naked Whey. (A "full" serving is two scoops, so this is why I call my one-scoop shake a half-size shake.)
* About 8 ounces of organic milk.
* About 1 tbsp of raw cacao.

Altogether, this is about 12 + 8 = 20 grams of protein. (12 from the Naked Whey powder, 8 from the milk. There's also about 1 gram in the raw cacao as a bonus!)

Here's what it looks like before and after blending:

As you may be able to see, it blends pretty well! The shake tastes evenly distributed, and there aren't any "chunks" of powder in it. So I think Naked Whey blends pretty well, evne though there are no emulsifiers.

One thing worth noting, though, is that the shake won't stay perfectly blended. Over time, the liquid "settles" towards the bottom of the shake, leaving a sort of whey foam at the top. Here's a picture taken after about 5 minutes of the shake sitting on the counter:

As you can see, the shake has settled a bit at the bottom. I don't find this to be a big deal; if I drink the shake quickly, it doesn't have time to settle. And if I do notice any settling, I just close the cap and give it one or two more shakes, which always solves the problem.

So in conclusion: Naked Whey blends well, in my opinion. One thought to end on is that I think a shaker bottle (or blender) is essential here. It's quite hard to blend with just a cup and a spoon, but a blender bottle or a blender makes a great shake.
